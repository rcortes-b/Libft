## 🚀 Getting Started  🚀 

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the Libft repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rcortes-b/Libft.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```sh
cd Libft
```

3. Compile the dependencies:
```sh
make
```

### 🤖 Use Libft
Once the library is successfully compiled, you can use it in your projects. Link the `libft.a` file to your program, and include the `libft.h` header in your source files.
To compile your program with Libft, use:
```sh
gcc -o my_file my_file.c -L . -lft
```
